\noindent This document illustrates the construction of a graph using the \textbf{Monotonic Relative Neighborhood Graph (MRNG)} for a set of points $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5$. It also demonstrates how the graph is used to search for the nearest neighbor to a query point $q$, which is \textbf{not} part of the original graph. See Figure~\autoref{fig:mrng-diagram}.

\subsection*{MRNG Construction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vertices:} The points $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5$ are the vertices of the graph.
    \item \textbf{Directed Edges:} For each point, all other points are sorted by distance. A directed edge from $u$ to $v$ is added if, within the lune (the intersection of the circles centered at $u$ and $v$ passing through each other), there is no other point $w$ such that an edge from $u$ to $w$ already exists and $w$ is closer to $u$ than $v$.
    \item \textbf{Lunes:} The shaded regions in the diagram represent the lunes for each pair of points. \\ 
    \textit{The lune here helps understand which points are closer: if a third point $w$ exists inside the lune of vertices $u$ and $v$, then $w$ is closer to both $u$ and $v$ than they are to each other.} This property is used to decide whether a direct edge should be formed between $u$ and $v$.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection*{Query Point and Search}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Query Point $q$:} The point $q$ is not part of the original graph.
    \item \textbf{Search Process:} To find the nearest neighbor to $q$, the search starts from a given vertex (e.g., $p_1$) and, at each step, moves to the neighbor that is greedily closer to $q$. The process stops when no neighbor is closer to $q$ than the current point.
    \item \textbf{MRNG Navigability:} MRNG guarantees that every point in the graph is reachable from every other point (all-point navigability). However, this guarantee does \textbf{not} extend to query points that are not part of the graph.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Observation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the illustrated example, if the search for the nearest neighbor to $q$ starts at $p_1$, the search path is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p_1 \rightarrow p_2 \rightarrow p_3$
        \item The search stops at $p_3$ because none of its neighbors are closer to $q$.
        \item However, the true nearest neighbor to $q$ is $p_5$, not $p_3$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} MRNG does \textbf{not} guarantee that the nearest neighbor search will succeed for query points not in the graph, even though it guarantees navigability for all points within the graph.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MRNG} is useful for constructing navigable graphs for a set of points.
    \item \textbf{Nearest neighbor search} using MRNG may fail for external query points, as shown in the diagram.
    \item \textbf{Practical implication:} For applications like approximate nearest neighbor search, additional strategies may be needed to ensure correct results for queries outside the original dataset.
\end{itemize}
